## Introduction

Leetcode is a platform that offers coding challenges and problems to enhance your algorithm and data structure skills. In this repository, I aim to document my solutions to these problems, along with explanations and thought processes behind each solution.

## Problem Categories

- **Linked List**
- **Pandas**
- **Problems**
- **Recursion**

Feel free to explore each category and the corresponding solutions.
## Usage
Each solution is implemented in a separate file and is structured to solve a specific problem. You can run the code snippets in your local environment or test them directly on the Leetcode platform.
